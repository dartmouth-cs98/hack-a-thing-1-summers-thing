### Description
For Hack-a-thing-1, my final product is a HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that allows you to input how long your showers are  and how large your bathtub is, and it then tells you which option would be more water efficient.

### What you learned
I had never done anything even remotely front-end, which meant I had never touched any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in my live. I originally set out to build this site with React, so I began with React's tic-tac-toe tutorial. I then wanted to at least make a draft of the layout in HTML so that I could know what components I'd really be working with. Going in, I really didn't understand what parts of frontend development went where, but I got so sucked into learning HTML and CSS through flexboxfroggy.com but mostly trial and error with what I learned from w3schools, that I realized my site nearly had its full functionality without React and I spent more than sufficient time on it. In fact, since I didn't have many moving parts, I only needed one function in the end, so React seemed like overkill.

### What didnâ€™t work
Like I said, I really didn't understand what parts of what I wanted to build should be in HTML vs. CSS vs. JavaScript, so I started with everything in one file. Well, really, I started by trying to adapt the tic-tac-toe tutorial code to do what I wanted, but I realized I'd have more direction if I laid out the skeleton of my desired page in HTML first. My unfamiliarity also made it hard to even research questions at first. I first built the inputs to be clunky dropdown menus with buttons because I just didn't know other options existed, so going back in and researching what else was out there would have been a good idea earlier in the process. Of course, React didn't quite work out, but that was a conscious choice to move away from it because it just didn't make sense for the situation, though I enjoyed learning about it first.
